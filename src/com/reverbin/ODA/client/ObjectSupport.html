<h3>Coming Soon!</h3>
<p>Looks like you are trying to upload a Windows PE executable or an ELF executable.  Good news!  While ODA currently supports only 
raw binary data, enhanced support for Windows PE and ELF object types is coming soon.  Stay tuned!

In the meantime, you'll have to convert your executable to raw binary data.  ODA currently treats PE and ELF files as raw binary data, 
so things will probably not appear as expected.
